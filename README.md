# Mood Anime Search

Find anime recommendations based on how you feel rather than searching by title or genre.

## About

Mood Anime Search transforms how you discover anime by letting you search with natural language descriptions of your mood. Instead of browsing genres or titles, simply describe what kind of experience you're looking for.

Examples:
- "I need something uplifting after a long day"
- "Looking for an anime that will make me cry"
- "Something exciting with good fight scenes"
- "A relaxing slice of life for bedtime"

## Features

- **Mood-Based Discovery**: Search anime by describing your current mood or desired feeling
